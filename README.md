## 📌 About the Project

This repository contains the source code of my professional portfolio, designed to be simple, fast, and entirely maintained using native JavaScript without frameworks.  
It includes:

- **Multilingual system** (PT-BR, PT-PT, EN, ES) powered by translation tables in `i18n_data.js`  
- **Dark/Light theme**, persisted via LocalStorage  
- **Responsive mobile menu** with animated hamburger icon (`menu.js`)  
- **Automatic slideshows** inside project cards (`script.js`)  
- **Modular structure** separating:  
  - Static HTML  
  - A single CSS file powering the entire website  
  - JavaScript split into menu logic, internationalization, and main functionality

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**  
- **CSS3** (dark theme, responsive layout, adaptive grid system)
